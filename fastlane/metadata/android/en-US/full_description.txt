<i>Sobriety</i> is simple and minimal app to track how long you've been sober from anything you want.

I mostly designed this out of spite for "I Am Sober", which monetizes addiction recovery. The whole first release was written in a day (specifically 03/10/2022) in the spare time I had between classes. I hope it eventually becomes a true competitor to IAS, because I really can't stand their buisness model.

<i>Sobriety</i> is designed to be simple: You input a starting date and time, as well as a name for the addiction, and it tells you how long it's been since you last logged a relapse.
